# Acorn Documents from Andrew Gordon (Acorn & SJ Research)

These documents have been grouped into directories based on the organisation of the original physical documents. In other words, if a document was found in a physical folder marked 'Prestel' then the scanned document will be in a folder called 'Prestel' even if it is clear that the document is not Prestel related.
