# Acorn Documents from Andrew Gordon

This repository contains scans of documents provided by Andrew Gordon from his time working at Acorn and SJ Research.

__Note:__
The documents have been grouped into directories based on the organisation of the original physical documents. In other words, if a document was found in a physical folder marked 'Prestel' then the scanned document will be in a folder called 'Prestel' even if it is not immediately obvious that the document is Prestel related.
